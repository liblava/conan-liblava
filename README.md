# Conan package recipe for [liblava](https://github.com/liblava/liblava).

liblava is a modern and easy-to-use library for the VulkanÂ® API

# Build and package

The following command will build liblava and publish the Conan package to the local system cache:

```bash
conan create . lavablock/stable
```

## Config

It's possible that you need to configure Conan to use your preferred compiler and build settings. For example, to compile a release build with Clang you could use the following config:

```ini
include(default)

[settings]
compiler=clang
compiler.version=9
compiler.cppstd=20
build_type=Release

[env]
CC=clang-9
CXX=clang++-9
```

Save it as *config_clang* and create the package:

```bash
conan create . lavablock/stable -pr=config_clang
```

For more profile configuration options, refer to the [Conan docs](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/profiles.html).

# Usage

Add a dependency to liblava to your project's *conanfile.txt*:

```ini
[requires]
liblava/0.6.0@lavablock/stable
```

and install all requirements:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
conan install ..
```

For more information, refer to [Using packages](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/using_packages.html).
